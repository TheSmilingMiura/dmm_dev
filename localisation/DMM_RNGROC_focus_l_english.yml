CHI_anewdisarmamentagreement_desc:0 "After the defeat of the last conventionally operating National Revolutionary Army units in 1946, Japan imposed upon us strict terms to keep us from fielding an army capable to oppose them. The treaties stipulate among other things that 'all deployment of divisions is to be approved by the Imperial Army Headquarters in Tokyo'. Although the regulations have been informally relaxed due to the IJA's demand for auxiliary forces, some divisions have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo, like the '1st Motorized Infantry Division "Wang Jingwei"', proposed in 1972 and still neither apporoved nor denied. We will propose a new, more streamlined, and more favourable treaty. This should help both the IJA and us."

CHI_civilianinstructors:0 "'Civilian' Instructors"

CHI_secretmeetingwithzaibatsuofficials_desc:0 "Through Niwa's contacts, we have managed to arrange a meeting with officials of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. If we agree to let them access our internal markets, they'll surely 'overlook' the Imperial Sanction against exporting weapons to China."

CHI_discoverlostjapaneseheavyequipment_desc:0 "We've stumbled upon a cache of heavy Japanese equipment, even including tanks.

CHI_a_firm_hand_desc:0 "What China needs is not some radical from the sticks shaking up a riot, nor a rabid Japanese nationalist like the IJA elite. We must be careful to steer between Scylla and Charybdis, lest we be ripped into their abyss."

CHI_consider_the_united_front_desc:0 "We must consider the interests of the popular PNR-YP United Front and their leader, Liu Zhongjing, if only to get to know our enemy. Their populist poisoning which threatens our system must be stopped, and the best way this can be done is by addressing their issues in a less radical fashion."
CHI_reassure_the_garrison:0 "Reassure the Nanjing Garrison"
CHI_reassure_the_garrison_desc:0 "The Garrison has become more and more concerned with us 'drifting away from Panasianism'. We must assuage their worries, for we can not stand against their wrath."
CHI_concede_some_autonomy:0 "Concede partial autonomy"
CHI_concede_some_autonomy_desc:0 "To kill a movement as powerful as the Liuist United Front, we must cut into their reasons to exist. We will accede to some of the demands of their moderate supporters consisting mainly of increased autonomy for the provincial governors. That should decrease Liu's ability to entice the masses decidedly."
CHI_maintain_the_balance:0 "Maintain the fragile balance"
CHI_maintain_the_balance_desc:0 "Everything is perfect as is. There is no need for the system to greatly change, it has served us since the 40's - obviously it is the best choice. We shall start a propaganda campaign for the Status Quo."
CHI_reinforce_our_allies:0 "Reinforce Our Allies"
CHI_reinforce_our_allies_desc:0 "We must aid the IJA forces fighting the anarchist scum in the interior. We will commit our own army to the Interior Front!"
CHI_attract_new_investments:0 "Attract New Investments"
CHI_attract_new_investments_desc:0 "Our economy has become a bit more sluggish recently, but our great President Wang has come up with the ideal solution: Opening the markets to more Japanese companies to bring investments!"
CHI_reinforce_panasianist_propaganda:0 "Strenghten Panasianist Propaganda"
CHI_reinforce_panasianist_propaganda_desc:0 "We will increase the amount of pro-Japan and pro-Panasianist propaganda disseminated throughout our entire country massively. On the TV, the Radio, the Newspapers, on the bus, in schools, in the factories...we will tell them a thousand times until even the most ridiculous lies become truth."
CHI_hongwen_economy_laogai_desc:0 "Our Great Leader Liu has decided to endorse Wang Hongwen's 'Laogai Plan', which calls for economic growth to be achieved via forced labour by prisoners. While extreme, this seems to have appealed to Liu's aim of a state built by the people themselves."
CHI_establish_the_facilities_desc:0 "We will establish a number of 'Facilities' throughout China to carry out the Laogai Plan. These will be factories with attached prisons to supply cheap workers."
CHI_harsher_legal_code_desc:0 "For the Plan to succeed, there must be a sufficient number of prisoners actually available. Unfortunately, that is not the case yet, but Mr. Wang has already proposed a number of legal changes that would greatly increase our labor supply."
CHI_work_quotas_desc:0 "The 'Facilities' have, so far, proved rather underwhelming in their production efficiency. However, Mr. Wang has already thought up a solution: Work Quotas that have harsh punishments if not met. This is sure to increase productivity."
CHI_redeploy_the_black_guards_desc:0 "Mr. Wang has approached Leader Liu with a great idea to improve the infrastructure throughout the nation: Why only use prisoners as factory labor? Why not use them as cheap workers to lay roads or tracks?"
CHI_bone_roads_desc:0 "Building roads is obviously great, but it is proceeding rather slowly in the eyes of Leader Liu. Anticipating this, the great Mr. Wang has already instructed the Laogai guards to execute anyone found to be too slow or even corroding morale."
CHI_redistribute_the_food_desc:0 "Why is it that the peasants in Jiangxi are starving while the merchants in Shanghai throw away unsold produce? We will institute harsh penalties on anyone found to be possessing excessive amounts of food."
CHI_even_if_it_means_people_are_malnourished_desc:0 "The Redistribution effort has been...not very successful, to say it kindly. Now both the peasants in the Interior and the inhabitants of great cities are starving. Nevertheless, we will push onwards! If there is not enough food to redistribute, we must seek out and punish hoarders even more viciously."
CHI_crank_up_the_pressure_desc:0 "The current work quotas are still insufficient, so the great Mr. Wang has ordered the Laogai guards to severely punish anyone found to be performing in any way inefficiently, like drinking too much water or talking to the other inmates."
CHI_dial_up_the_voltage_desc:0 "With the Laogai system still not reaching maximum performance in the eyes of Mr. Wang, he has decided to 'take off the velvet gloves'. Anyone found to be hindering the work process will be subjected to electric torture again and again, until they either reach their goals or die. It may seem brutal, but the prisoners are traitors to the people anyways."
CHI_modern_moorsoldaten_desc:0 "With Wang's efficiency projections fulfilled, he has seen with distaste some journalists in the US calling his treatment of prisoners 'Nazi-like' and 'inhumane'. We will create propaganda extolling the virtues of our 'Rehabilitation through Labor'."
CHI_hongwen_economy_working_soldiers_desc:0 "Our Great Leader Liu has decided to endorse Wang Hongwen's 'Soldier Plan', which calls for economic growth to be achieved via mobilizing parts of the army as workers. This seems to have caught Liu's attention as both a way to increase economic growth and discipline."
CHI_expand_conscription_plans_desc:0 "While using soldiers as workers is a fine plan, it won't work if there are not enough soldiers to go around. We will loosen our conscription regulations to fill the ranks of the new 'Work Armies'."
CHI_nation_calls_for_us_desc:0 "If the National Renewal is to be a truly complete cooperation of all parts of society, all must contribute to it. We will obligate everyone above the age of 12 to serve the state for at least one year."
CHI_incentives_for_volunteers_desc:0 "If the National Renewal is to have the support of the people, we must not be too harsh in finding additional workers. Instead, let us give rewards to those who volunteer for service instead, like medals and state-sponsored housing."
CHI_promotions_for_patriots_desc:0 "If we tie promotions in state-owned companies to having served a term of National Service, we will naturally find our upper ranks filled by these patriots. This will benefit us and them!"
CHI_bausoldaten_desc:0 "Currently, the Work Soldier term counts as regular military service. We will make it it's own assigned service to allow us to retain more qualified individuals in these 'Construction Bataillions'."
CHI_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "If we want to match the Great Powers of the world, we must develop our own Military-Industrial-Complex. We will allow the Construction Bataillions to be contracted by military companies too."
CHI_command_economy_desc:0 "With the increased synergy between military, heavy industry and the government, we have gained a great amount of control over the war-oriented parts of our industry. If we command, the factories follow."
CHI_civil_engagements_desc:0 "We will deploy a small number of Construction Soldiers to assist smaller companies in their day-to-day business. This will integrate society and military and strenghten our people's pride in their country."
CHI_parallel_railways_desc:0 "In case of war, our railway network will need to bear both the weight of troop transports and civilian demands. To circumvent any potential breakdown of our supply lines, we will construct a secondary railway network for exclusive military use."
CHI_organic_army_desc:0 "To achieve the National Renewal, we must integrate the Army firmly into society. We will compose our units of conscripts from the same area to foster a feeling of community both in- and outside the military."
CHI_civil_work_brigades_desc:0 "Praiseworthy Patriots have started to assemble civilian analogues to our Construction Bataillions. We should subsidise them and put them to good use."
CHI_factory_forces_desc:0 "To further unify military and economy, we will organise workers in divisional units, with the aim of increasing discipline and control and reducing unrest."
CHI_mobilization_economy_desc:0 "If we call for them, the masses will rise to aid us in any war. They will stream into the factories for meager wages out of patriotism. Our economy is built to support rapid and forceful mobilization."
CHI_always_ready_desc:0 "From the plains of Manchuria to the mountains of Yunnan, foes lurk. Ready to pounce on us any minute, they aim to sow discontent, but we will never allow that. Our people's watchword must be 'Vigilance'."
CHI_zhu_economy_free_markets_desc:0 "Our Great Leader Liu has decided to endorse Zhu Min's 'Liberal Plan', which calls for economic growth to be achieved via greatly deregulating the economy."
CHI_burn_the_red_tape_desc:0 "Our economy is suffocated by countless regulations, some of them dating as far back as the Qing Dynasty. For example, to found a company in Shanghai, one must gain not only the approval of the Imperial Ministry of Economy, but also that of half a dozen of our own ministries. We must fix this immediately, and the only way to do so is to burn all of the restrictive legislation to the ground."
CHI_privatise_the_railways_desc:0 "The railways of China have always been a drain on our budget. Why would we keep unprofitable routes running anyways? We shall organise an auction to sell off parts of our state railway company."
CHI_rolles_lemma_and_the_laffer_curve_desc:0 "The Man who says that more taxation means more taxes is a Man soon to be poor. The Laffer Curve shows that there is a distinct point between a tax rate of 0% and of 100% that gives a maximum of tax revenue. We will task our most competent economists with finding that point."
CHI_violate_schumpeters_theorem_desc:0 "The Austrian Economist Joseph Schumnpeter once postulated that 'A dog would rather create a sausage reserve, than a democratic government would build one of money'. Our great New Democracy will prove him wrong. We shall create a great budget surplus to help tide us over even the most vicious crisis."
CHI_monetarism_desc:0 "Mr. Zhu has recently been reading a number of books by the American Economist Milton Friedman. He has come to support a theory Friedman calls 'Monetarism' which rejects government intervention in the markets, instead aiming to influence the economy by controlling the amount of money in circulation at any given time."
CHI_the_freer_the_markets_desc:0 "We must free the markets from the restrictive laws placed upon them by the incompetent Wang administration. We will start a set of ambitious reforms to revitalize the economy."
CHI_the_freer_the_people_desc:0 "The most egregious form of modern slavery is the economic slavery imposed by high taxation upon the individual. The freer the markets, the freer the people are to forge their own destiny. We must start further reforms immediately!"
CHI_the_freer_we_are_to_act_desc:0 "The less restrictive our laws are, the more money we have, the more money we have, the greater our capability to develop both our nation and our reserves. Money is Freedom!"
CHI_big_profits_big_reserves_desc:0 "The British forced the Qing into economic vassalage and opened the door to more than a century of abuse by the Great Powers. Never again will we let that happen! Our great monetary reserves mean that we are able to stimulate the economy if a foreign power dares to encroach on it, and our deep pockets will protect us against economic threats. Our Reserve is Our Fortress!"
CHI_tame_the_zaibatsus_desc:0 "With Japan weakened, and its Empire falling apart at the seams, we may find ourselves in a position to renegotiate the exploitative contracts signed in the late '40s. We will give Japan a choice: Either they reign in their companies, or we will take manners...into our own hands."
CHI_a_national_bank_desc:0 "Until now, all our trade, money traffic and other such things have run through either small local banks or the giant Zaibatsu-owned Japanese banks. Another country having this amount of control over our monetary traffic is a recipe for disaster, and so will establish something sorely needed: the 'Zhongguo Guomin Yinhang' or 'National Bank of China'."
CHI_our_own_stock_exchange_desc:0 "With our measures towards increased privatisation, China has seen the rise of its first sizable private companies owned by Chinese. Now that these companies are at the stage to prepare for an initial public offering, why should they have to do that on the Tokyo Stock Exchange? We will open the Shanghai Stock Exchange to attract them instead."
CHI_zhu_economy_social_markets_desc:0 "Our Great Leader Liu has decided to endorse Zhu Min's 'Social Plan', which calls for a revitalization of the economy to be achieved by means of limited privatization and deregulation, but expressly stating that 'no measure taken by the government in the execution of this plan may lower the average citizen's standard of living'."
CHI_controlled_burn_desc:0 "While it is true that the amount of restrictive legislation regarding our economy is extreme, some of these laws exist for a reason. Instead of recklessly throwing laws to the bonfire, we must carefully consider which bills should be repealed in something Mr. Zhu calls a 'controlled burn'."
CHI_subsidise_the_small_guy_desc:0 "While privatization is key to economic recovery, we must be careful to not end up with Zaibatsus of our own. While some privatized assets obviously require capital to buy them (like heavy industry). On the other hand, we should assist non-conglomerate buyers by subsidising their operations for the first few years to make sure they are not swallowed by potential rivals."
CHI_public_work_projects_desc:0 "With the money we gained from privatization, we may now start to fix a great problem, maybe even the greatest, plaguing China today: Unemployment. We will employ as many people as we can in an ambitious plan to expand infrastructure, promoting the growth of private industry and therefore creating jobs for themselves."
CHI_expand_the_welfare_state_desc:0 "'A state is not justified in its existence unless it cares for its weakest members' were the final words of a fiery speech delivered by Leader Liu in Nanchang today. We must expand social and financial aid programs if we do not want to degenerate to the level of the Germans. We have the money for it, so why should we hoard it?"
CHI_bust_the_monopolies_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, monopolies have started cropping up, especially in the areas of food processing and retail. This is bound to harm the consumer, so we must step in, pass Anti-Trust legislation immediately and break up the conglomerates that have already formed. For the Greater Good."
CHI_if_we_work_together_desc:0 "Cooperation is vital not only to the continued cohesion of society, but also to economic cohesion as well. We must promote a spirit of unity and cooperation amongst our people, regardless of their social status."
CHI_we_can_bring_prosperity_desc:0 "We must aim to establish a set standard of living that can be called 'minimum' and help every citizen achieve it before we embark on some great crusade to raise quality of life for all."
CHI_to_even_the_poorest_homes_desc:0 "It is time to finally start our great campaign of social reform across China, to bring prosperity to even the poorest homes!"
CHI_big_profits_big_reinvestments_desc:0 "Our Economy is prosperous, our people are living happy lives, and the profits are flowing into our coffers constantly. What sense would there be in hoarding all of it? We will reinvest it into our economy and our welfare programs."
CHI_a_booming_economy_desc:0 "We have entered a great period of prosperity! Our reforms have paid off, and we have come out of this crisis stronger than ever. We have truly created a strong economic footing for a strong state to stand on."
CHI_xie_economy_shengzhang_desc:0 "Mr. Xie has gained the approval of Leader Liu for his 'Shengzhang Plan', which entails a devolved industrialisation initiative to be carried out with the help of the Shengzhang, China's provincial governors."
CHI_just_development_desc:0 "For a truly equal development, we must formulate 'Equality' as a main goal for our development planning, lest we cause anger between the provinces."
CHI_economic_redistribution_plan_desc:0 "The Shengzhang obviously have different amounts of money at their disposal to carry out the plan, which is inherently against the premise of 'Equality'. We will set up a common fund to finance the Shengzhang plan, with contributions based on the prosperity of the respective province."
CHI_every_governor_a_king_desc:0 "We will officially give the Shengzhang the order to propose development plans for their province within realistic bounds."
CHI_local_planning_commisions_desc:0 "The time has come to audit the planning commissions set up by the Shengzhang on their budgets and the necessity of every single element of their planning. This will ensure that we trim any unnecessary fat and corruption."
CHI_construction_cooperatives_desc:0 "We have recognised that the state can make better deals with companies than the individual governors could. We will form such 'Construction Cooperatives' to assist the Shengzhang in their planning."
CHI_anti_authoritarian_planning_desc:0 "We will establish several control instances to make sure no governor, no matter how powerful, can threaten his way into gaining a greater share of planned investment for his province."
CHI_allocate_the_funds_desc:0 "Planning has ended, now we must actually pay the Cooperatives to carry out the planning."
CHI_urban_rural_integration_desc:0 "A great conflict dividing China is the conflict between city and land, worker and peasant. We must improve infrastructural and economic ties between the two regions by subsidising railways and trade."
CHI_help_the_farmers_desc:0 "We will subsidise the introduction of more advanced farming methods in rural China."
CHI_cross_province_infrastructure_desc:0 "To help remove disparities between the provinces, we will construct railways linking the provincial capitals together, hopefully facilitating cooperation and internal trade."
CHI_open_the_waterways_desc:0 "To further facilitate internal trade, we will start projects to deregulate goods transports on the major rivers of China, where already possible, and make them navigable where it is not."
CHI_split_the_state_companies_desc:0 "The state-owned companies are inherently working against our planning by coordinating production to demand across province borders, thus reducing potential internal trade. They will have to go."
CHI_internal_autonomy_desc:0 "We have created a system where the provinces mainly gain funds by way of the high amount of low tariffs on inter-province trade. They, in turn, pass a smaller part of this revenue on to us, but are able to decide on their own what they should invest in most of the time. This is, of course, not economically ideal, but it does match Leader Liu's autonomist ideas quite well."
CHI_xie_economy_work_societies_desc:0 "Mr. Xie has gained the approval of Leader Liu for his 'Work Society Plan', an ambitious initiative to unite all social groups involved in industrial processes under one banner to achieve high efficiency."
CHI_establish_local_factories_desc:0 "We will never be able to get completely anonymous individuals to come to a uniform consensus even if they are from different backgrounds. For this reason, we shall contract construction companies to build factories even in more remote areas, to prepare for the later stages of the plan."
CHI_unite_them_all_desc:0 "We will establish the 'Work Societies' as a more corporatist approach to unionism. This, however, depends on us being actually able to unite all necessary groups despite their often opposing interests."
CHI_the_workers_desc:0 "The cooperation of the workers is essential if we want to smash the power of unionism among them."
CHI_better_conditions_desc:0 "We will enter into negotiations with the workers across the nation to achieve their cooperation, but one thing they will not budge on is higher wages and better working conditions."
CHI_the_capitalists_desc:0 "If we do not gain the favor of the factory owners, we can give up on achieving our goal of a corporatist factory system."
CHI_tax_breaks_desc:0 "The factory owners, like all wealthy men, are tempted by promises to have the state take less of their savings. We shall give them just what they want, if they join us."
CHI_the_militiamen_desc:0 "The Patriotic Militias are the spine of Dear Leader Liu's rule, so to leave them out would be like leaving out Leader Liu himself - an unforgivable crime worthy of a thousand deaths."
CHI_work_squads_desc:0 "By organising the workers into combat squads, we gain the benefit of added discipline among them, and the militias gain many new members. A win-win situation, one would say. The workers? Well...they surely won't mind."
CHI_the_politicians_desc:0 "If we don't gain the support of the politicians, we will find stones thrown into our path with every step we take."
CHI_non_partisan_union_desc:0 "The politicians have always been fearful of unionism and its socialist agitations. If we can convince them we can tame the worker's spirit, we might just gain a very powerful ally."
CHI_corporatist_localism_desc:0 "It is time to officially found the work societies and put them under state control. With this, we can finally end any sort of anti-patriotic or anti-efficiency unrest or movements in the factories."
CHI_pulse_of_the_nation_desc:0 "A new pulse runs through the nation's economy, as the members of the 'Work Societies' have found themselves in a vicious cycle: If the factory owners demand increased production, any unrest among the workers is crushed by the factory combat squads. The politicians, seeing the increased income of the owners, tax them more, leading to them demanding even more productivity."
CHI_harmony_economy_desc:0 "With the cycle created by the 'Work Societies' stabilising at a high level of taxation and a high level of 'expected' worker productivity, nothing seems like it could go wrong. No, seriously, what could happen? The workers are subdued, the factory owners kept in check by the politicians, and the politicians are kept in check by Leader Liu and his militias. A perfect system without fail!"
