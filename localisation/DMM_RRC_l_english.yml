POLITICS_Zhu_Fuxi_DESC:0 "Zhu Fuxi, born in 1955 in Linhai, Zhejiang Province in Eastern China, has been many things across his career: A prodigious student in school, a committed KMT member and student of Wang Jingwei Thought, but also always showing some unpredictability in his actions. This greatly served him when he entered Nanjing Military Academy in 1973, at the ripe age of eighteen, where he regularly excelled when it came to applying unconventional approaches to strategic problems that had many of his fellow students resort to tried-and-true methods. After being commissioned as an officer for the National Revolutionary Army, Zhu successfully carried out several effective counterinsurgency operations in Jiangsu, distinguishing himself as one of the few officers actually commanding a force which neither suffered disproportionate casualties in anti-partisan operations nor by desertion. This saw him quickly climbing the ranks of the NRA. However, the architect of the Pacification of Eastern Jiangsu and the Guangxi Encirclement Campaigns had attracted the attention of an enemy he could not, with all his skill, defeat. The Imperial Japanese Army, wary of allowing the NRA to recover too much strength and equally apprehensive about Zhu's harsh anti-corruption and highly nationalist attitude, engineered a scandal in which Zhu was alleged to have committed numerous acts of debauchery such as adultery, theft of military assets and bribery, ruining the public image of the 'Young General'. Under pressure from Japan, the army leadership stripped Zhu of multiple ranks and assigned him a command in far-off Sichuan to rot and be forgotten in. But while much of China has forgotten Zhu Fuxi, Zhu has not forgotten China. Ever furious, the now-aged 'Young General' looks still Eastward at Nanjing cursing those who he sees as traitors to the state and Wang Jingwei's ideals. Even greater is his hatred for the Japanese, and the passive ambivalence of his youth has turned into an embittered aversion and avoidance of all things Japanese. While Zhu is aware of his rather shaky position as an outsider reliant on supplies from Nanjing, he cares little. After all, he does not plan to stay in Sichuan forever..."
POLITICS_Lin_Shusen_DESC:0 "While the Nanjing Government appoints many Governors to its various provinces, there are few among them that can claim to be anything other than a puppet to rubber-stamp local Chinese and Japanese military operations that blindly extract maximum financial returns out of their demesne. Lin Shusen is one of the few exceptions. Born in 1946 in Shantou, Guangdong Province, to a local government official in the chaotic postwar period, Lin was a voracious reader from a young age, reading not only his school textbooks voraciously, but also taking an interest in political theory in his early teens. From the works of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen to Smith's 'Wealth of Nations', to even more elusive books: a copy of 'Mein Kampf', obtained via correspondence with the German ambassador in Nanjing, and 'Das Kapital', bought at a frankly ironically high price on the black market, Lin bases his personal ideology and policy on a strange mix of corporatism, socialism, aspects of Laissez-Faire economics and political liberalism, applying whatever he feels is the best solution to a specific problem. Following his father's footsteps and entering into politics as a young adult after working some years as a technical engineer, Lin's pragmatic and non-dogmatic approach to problems made him successful and frankly unpromotable at the same time. Faced with the dilemma of a rare competent administrator being politically rather unreliable, the Nanjing Administration chose, after long deliberation, to resolve the situation by promoting Lin Shusen to Governor of Guizhou, a politically and economically quite unimportant province, to observe his actions without the possibility of much damage. Unlike his predecessors to the Governorship, Lin has not despaired at the poverty of Guizhou, and instead has started to improve the quality of life there one small step of the time according to the motto of 'Helping people help themselves', giving subsidies to farmers to modernize their equipment, trying to make landlords and peasants work together instead of rallying one against the other - and being the only Governor to reduce funding to the Provincial Army to fund his own policies. This has obviously not gone over well with the NRA, and only time can tell if Lin Shusen's popularity with the common folk can maintain his reign..."
POLITICS_Li_Daqiu_DESC:0 "Born in 1953 in Zhaoping County, Guangxi, Li Daqiu worked as a rather unremarkable local administrator of the Hezhou area in Eastern Guangxi until the late 1980s, when significant gold resources were discovered in his home county of Zhaoping. Guangxi's mineral wealth had recently come to the notice of several Zaibatsu, and even though the poor and mountainous state of the province would necessitate significant additional investments, the suspected vast nature of the veins meant that requests for mining rights soon flooded Li's table. Principled administrators would have bargained for a share of the wealth gained to flow back into the community, or even stipulated work regulations to prevent the fatalaties so often observed in the Japanese resource extraction operations across China. Li resolved to bargain with the Zaibatsu representatives, inviting plenipotentiaries from such great names as Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Fujita and Nissan. After hours of negotiation, Li signed the mining rights over to Mitsubishi and walked away from the table with several concessions:\n\n-A brand-new Second Generation Mitsubishi Debonair\n-An "appreciative gift" of several ten thousand yen\n-A bottle of expensive Kikuhime Kukurihime sake\n and a promise of "help in the matters of career advancement".\n\nWithin three years, Li had, with significant Japanese backing, secured the governorship of his home province of Guangxi. He knows his position depends on the Japanese, and has tried to build a personal power base in the province's divided politics, although his active collaborationism significantly hinders this. And as the Japanese economy slumps more and more from stagnation into outright depression, Li asks himself often if he is not on the list of assets to be cut soon..."
