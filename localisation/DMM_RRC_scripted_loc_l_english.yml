It is dubious if anyone really looked good in this..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_2:0 "'The only thing Mr. Liu has done in this Republic is sabotage it at every turn!', is what Wang attempts to say before being quite quickly interrupted by a torrent of filibustering coming from Liu. Although it prevents Wang from being able to make his point, some elder members of the Assembly click their tongues at Liu's impertinent behaviour..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_3:0 "'This 'United Front' you lead is naught but malcontent losers(...)', Wang starts, but he is stopped by a flurry of thrown pens and even a suitcase hitting his podium, with Wang being forced to seek shelter behind his desk. Although he has been prevented from making his point, such measures are frowned upon even in the rough climate of the ROC's assembly chamber..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_4:0 "'The Youth Party was shunned by our Japanese Allies(...)', Wang attempts to continue, but is booed heavily from both the back rows of his own party and the entire PNR-YP front. Referring to the hated Japanese as 'Allies', although theoretically correct, was perhaps not the smartest move, although the Japanese-aligned delegates direct a scornful gaze towards Liu..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_5:0 "Wang shouts: 'Mr. Liu wants to dismantle the Republic itself. We MUST stop him!', but is quickly shut down when Liu launches into a furious rant about the systemic issues of the Reorganized Government, and meekly shrinks behind his desk. The Old Guard of the NDPROC watches Liu's rant with disdain..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_6:0 "'Wang tries to ride into office on his father's coattails - Are we a monarchy again?', Liu tries to argue, but is quickly drowned out by furious noises from the NDPROC ranks, as he is seen as disrepecting the dead Old President..."

  rrc_response_attack_heavy_9:0 "'I will solve China's problems, not some dusty National Democrat in this chamber.'. This remark is quickly met with immense rage from the NDPROC's ranks, who throw a number of things, including, but not limited to: 13 pens, 2 folders full of documents, and 1 steel cigarette case. This causes Liu to take shelter behind his desk, rather ruining the point he was making..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_10:0 "Liu shouts: 'Every district which Wang's party governs is a district exploited by corrupt bureaucrats', but he is immediately interrupted by Wang, who alleges that their districts 'at least remain governable, contrary to yours'..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_11:0 "Wang begins to speak: 'Mr. Liu speaks of a 'Great Devolution', but is it not merely filthy Anarchism in disguise?'. Liu attempts to interject, but Wang just starts to speak louder: 'Mr. Liu, I ask you this? Are you not attempting to tear down everything every politician since 1911 has tried to built? A strong China, a united China. Mr. Liu, you stand against all of that, and you expect me and us all to just sit by idly while you destroy our life's work?'. Wang is applauded loudly by his delegation and Liu is left unable to answer sufficiently..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_12:0 "'The only thing Mr. Liu has done in this Republic is sabotage it at every turn!', Wang begins. Liu's attempts to make a counterpoint are swiftly swatted down, and he is subjected to almost half an hour of Wang viciously tearing apart his arguments one after the other. By the time Wang is finished, many believe this might be the killing blow to Liu's young political career..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_13:0 "'This 'United Front' you lead is naught but malcontent losers, aiming to destroy the system my father and his father worked their whole lives to build!'. Wang's invocation of the authority of his father and grandfather works, and Liu's attempts to interrupt Wang are mercilessly torn down by the NDPROC delegates. Wang goes on and on about Liu attempting 'to destroy everything we hold dear today'. By the end, Liu is catching suspicious looks from even his own party members."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_14:0 "'The Youth Party was shunned by our Japanese Allies for a reason - they are too radical!', Wang begins. 'They saw them as the threat to China that they were, and it is only because we allowed them into our midst again that Japan does not trust us!'. This catches the agreement of most of Wang's supporters, and Liu is shocked to see some of his PNR delegates cross the floor and sit with the NDP faction..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_15:0 "Wang warns: 'Mr. Liu wants to dismantle the Republic itself. We MUST stop him before it is too late!'. Liu tries to say something, but Wang talks over him: 'Liu wishes to see the Chinese state destroyed, our identity broken - He is much like the British in that regard'. Liu's attempted rebuttal is drowned out by calls to remove him from the assembly floor, and although no such thing happens, his position is weakened immensely..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_16:0 "'Wang tries to ride into office on his father's coattails - Are we a monarchy again?', Liu asks, shouting over Wang's remarks, 'Should we just invite the Manchurian Emperor back and be done with it? No, I say. Save the republic, and do not support Mr. Wang.'. This allegation seems to have convinced some of Wang's devotees, who now look at him with critical eyes..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_17:0 "Wang attempts to speak, but is cut off by Liu: 'The only change Mr. Wang can promise is one for the worse - Stagnation!', he postulates, 'He promises reform, but he has never said what kind of reform. He is vague so that he can later just agree to his Japanese Master's demands'. The storm of allegations overwhelms Wang, who fails to properly refute them all. Some of the NDP delegates even cross the floor and sit with the PNR-YP front..."
  rrc_response_attack_heavy_18:0 "'Wang calls for 'Reform, not Revolution', but his actions are those of a Japanese lapdog!', Liu shouts, over Wang's protests, 'Whatever he does, he always takes care to not offend his Japanese Masters. In the morning he calls Tokyo just to ask if he is allowed to brush his teeth that day'. The assembly roars with laughter at Wang's expense, who is visibly embarrassed..."

'Be quiet, your family's policies got us into this situation in the first place!', he says to Wang, quieting him down. 'While many will proclaim that the system is not flawed, these people have not been in the Interior for a day in their lives!', he continues. 'We must make changes, or we will not stand the test of time'. The PNR-YP delegation applauds, while the NDP faction is mostly silent, looking at Wang inquisitively..."

You people call us radicals, but at the very least, we do not steal from our constituents like you. I have brought with me this document...'

The burned wreckage of the armored command vehicle, however, showed severe damage consistent with German-made RPzB 88 anti-tank rocket guns, sparking concerns over the increasing availability of modern weapons to partisan bands.

Already wrecked by changing warlord and communist rule before the Great Liberation of 1937, with the accession of Inner Mongolia to Mengjiang the region drifted into the periphery of a China rife with economic ailments. Now, local officials have reported that communist propaganda has once more been spotted in several towns, and the populace seems to eagerly fall for it..."

  dmm_wang_wenying_desc3:0 "To prevent KMT or, even worse, Communist propaganda from reaching and influencing the people, we have always closely regulated what media may be published in the Republic. Others may call it censorship - for us it is common sense. Now, however, an ever increasing number of illegal books and magazines is going into circulation, many with outrageous names, the 'Black Book of Japanese Imperialism' and the newspaper 'Asia Uncensored' being especially egregious examples.

This allows the mines to bring in tremendous amounts of profit, at the expense of the safety of the miners. Today, at 7:44 AM, disaster finally struck, as the Taoxikeng Tungsten Mine in Western Jiangxi, run mainly by the Nissan Zaibatsu, suffered a massive tunnel collapse due to poor maintenance, trapping dozens of miners deep underground. The company has refused any responsibility, and claims that 'Chinese sabotage and idiocy' collapsed the mine, even demanding compensation from our government. With a telegram from Tokyo instructing us to oblige them, we have little choice in the matter, as humiliating as it may be."

After a recent speech in which he denounced the distance of government officials from the common folk by jesting that 'while one struggles to buy a tomato, the other can't decide which tuxedo to wear today', the attacks have, however, reached a new level, with civil servants in several cities being bombarded with ripe tomatoes every time they appear in formal wear. This destroys much of their authority..."

A rather small police station on the outskirts of Xi'An was entered yesterday at approximately 5 PM by masked gunmen, who reportedly shouted 'Freedom for the people! Down with the Japanese Devils!' before opening fire, methodically executing every officer in sight, but leaving the civilians present alone, though traumatised. The gunmen tore down and burned the Japanese flag hanging above the entrance door, and replaced the Chinese flag with the KMT-era version. The boldness shown in attacking a police station is startling, and we should immediately respond. But how?"

As the ship by itself should have been in no way able to explode in such a manner, officials have declared this incident 'a despicable act of terrorism', though why exactly the crowded ferry was chosen is still up for speculation. Nevertheless, the incident, which has left well over a thousand dead, has managed to grind the vibrant jewel of the East, Shanghai, to a halt, even if only for a moment."

However, a few days ago, a sympathetic guard 'forgot' to keep watch over the back door of Bao's house long enough for the man to escape and be picked up by a friend's car in what police officials have called 'a masterfully orchestrated escape'. Bao Tong apparently subsequently took the next flight to Irkutsk from Shanghai-Hongqiao under a fake ID. It is assumed he has already left Russia for the United States or Canada, where he will surely spread his poison to exactly the wrong people..."

Due to him accidentally stumbling while walking towards the microphone, Jiebing's head was missed by mere centimeters.

dmm_rrc_exec_yan_jiagan:0 "Yan Jiagan is a rare sight - a higher-ranking GMD politician that did not only not flee China after the War was lost, but one that managed to re-enter the Halls of Power under the new regime. Yan is widely recognized as being the inventor of land tax payments in natural produce during the War, potentially avoiding millions of famine deaths. Although subject in his policymaking to the President's whims, he has retained much popularity amongst the common folk, and many see in him one of the greatest sources of legitimacy for the Reorganized Nationalist Government."
dmm_rrc_legis_wang_jinping:0 "Wang Jinping is seen by many as a mere lapdog to the Japanese, having been born in Taiwan and growing up there. Nevertheless, there is one thing that no one can deride him as - inefficient. Wang is extremely talented at getting people to agree to his political efforts...by verbal or other means."
dmm_rrc_exam_kong_decheng:0 "An erudite with a most honorable lineage - that is Kong Decheng. The Professor at Nanjing University swore in 1937 to 'fight the Japanese as soon as I reach the age of military service', but was kept from serving in the Army due to his ceremonial importance - he is a direct descendant of Confucius in the 77th generation. He is effectively forced to participate in the government, as his children are closely 'guarded' by Kempeitai officers at all times. In his position as President of the Examination Yuan, Kong Decheng has always taken great care to deliberately weed out the most radical ideologues, but his great spiritual importance forbids direct action against him."

dmm_rrc_judic_xu_zongli:0 "A pragmatist of the post-GMD era, Xu Zongli is of the opinion that Man has to pick his battles diligently to live another day, which is why the President of the Judicial Yuan steers clear of attempting to start a prosecution against Japanese officials for infringing on Chinese laws - it is an unwinnable uphill battle. On the other hand, he is more than willing to prosecute any Chinese nationals infringing on the law - it's horrifyingly unjust, but it is pragmatic."

Should the government take any strong anti-Liuist actions, Li might demand an explanation or even more..."

As his body grows weaker, the elderly President is starting to see the cracks in his life's work - the stabilisation of China.
