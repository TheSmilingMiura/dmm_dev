A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "With the deployment of anti-ballistic-missile satellite networks by the world's three superpowers, Japan, the US and Germany, Mutually Assured Destruction has lost its bite. With Germany starting to recover under a new Führer, Japan bleeding itself white in partisan conflicts across Asia, and the US inbetween them, the future seems set for a new age of conflict even more lethal than the World Wars, as states struggle for survival. Will you lead your nation through this new dawn of conflict, or are your soldiers already just dead men marching?"
RRC_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "The Reorganized Nationalist Government of the Republic of China is under siege from all sides. The interior is plagued by partisans with both the IJA and the Republic's own military, the RNA, struggling to maintain even nominal control over everything east of Taiyuan and north of Guangxi. At the same time, Wang Wenying, President of the RNGROC ever since his father Jingwei's death in 1969, is expected to not survive the winter. The Republic is on the path to a power struggle between the radical Liu Zhongjing and the moderate Wang Jiebing, with the IJA Nanjing Garrison scheming in the background. This is truly the RNGROC's darkest hour."

BII_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "The Presidency of Fort Mountbatten is the last vestige of British Rule on the Indian Subcontinent. Embargoed and threatened by the members of the Indian Confederation and even Japan, the state owes its survival mostly to circumstance and resilience, and not its own strength. Although the official policy of the Presidency is 'the restoration of the British Empire in its pre-war borders', it is practically limited to the range of the guns of the old British coastal forts of Cochin. Will you be guided by Heaven's Light again, or will the sun finally set on the British Empire?"
