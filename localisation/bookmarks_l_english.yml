A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "With the deployment of anti-ballistic-missile satellite networks by the world's three superpowers, Japan, the US and Germany, Mutually Assured Destruction has lost its bite. With Germany starting to recover under a new Führer, Japan bleeding itself white in partisan conflicts across Asia, and the US inbetween them, the future seems set for a new age of conflict even more lethal than the World Wars, as states struggle for survival. Will you lead your nation through this new dawn of conflict, or are your soldiers already just dead men marching?"
RRC_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "The Reorganized Nationalist Government of the Republic of China is under siege from all sides. The interior is plagued by partisans with both the IJA and the Republic's own military, the RNA, struggling to maintain even nominal control over everything east of Taiyuan and north of Guangxi. At the same time, Wang Wenying, President of the RNGROC ever since his father Jingwei's death in 1969, is expected to not survive the winter. The Republic is on the path to a power struggle between the radical Liu Zhongjing and the moderate Wang Jiebing, with the IJA Nanjing Garrison scheming in the background. This is truly the RNGROC's darkest hour."

GER_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "It would be difficult to find anyone in the modern world who has not heard of the so called "Thousand Years Reich". After its victory in the second world war and slow detente with the United States, few would assume the German claim to power will ever go uncontested. However the final fight that the so called New Order has to face is not a material one, but rather within the heart of Germania. As reformists, speerites, hardliners and the military all struggle for power within marble halls of the great city a question remains for the continental spanning empire/:/Will the German grip hold? Or is it time for a new player to take the reigns?"
USA_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "United States stands tall against world slowly turning into embrace of authoritarianism. Since its founding it has dedicated its fight to preservation of democracy and it has maintained this tradition for centuries, and centuries to come. As its former allies Britain and France lie trempled under the German boot and Asia decays under the Japs, such duty grows necessary evermore. Will this torch of liberty keep burning or will its flame be extinguished in this troubled era?"
SOV_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "Defeated in the Great Patriotic War the story of Russia follows both fall and rise. Once just cesspit of anarchy, warlordism and insane ideologues, the russian people have united under one flag and goal for the first time in half a century. Filled with ambitions and sence of revanchism in mind, its only matter of time until the sleeping bear quits its calmness and embarks to take back what was rightfully its. By diplomacy or force."
BII_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "The Presidency of Fort Mountbatten is the last vestige of British Rule on the Indian Subcontinent. Embargoed and threatened by the members of the Indian Confederation and even Japan, the state owes its survival mostly to circumstance and resilience, and not its own strength. Although the official policy of the Presidency is 'the restoration of the British Empire in its pre-war borders', it is practically limited to the range of the guns of the old British coastal forts of Cochin. Will you be guided by Heaven's Light again, or will the sun finally set on the British Empire?"
JAP_A_NEW_DAWN_DESC:0 "In 1945 the fleet and army of the Japanese Empire brought Asia a gift it would never forget centuries after/:/Showa - Enlightened Peace. From then our countries rebuild from the shackles of imperialism, into the new world of Pan-Asian unity. However this bliss is opposed by many. Forced of western imperialism and godless communists both seek to undermine what years and years of building have given to us. Their pressure demands us to either take stand or submit to their subversion and hatred. And when the sphere yields, so will Asia."
