 election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."
 election.2.a:0 "The people must be heard."
 election.2.b:0 "Protecting our sovereignty comes first."
 election.3.t:0 "Election: Public Demands Rearmament"
 election.3.d:0 "The ongoing war approaching our borders has loomed over the upcoming election, with many voters being concerned that [Root.GetName] is not prepared for being thrown into this conflict or whatever may arise from it. They demand we increase our precautions and ensure that our nation is ready for war. While the majority still support [Root.GetRulingParty], we may lose them to more radical elements if we don't alleviate their apprehensions."

 election.3.b:0 "Many are still in favor of diplomatic solutions."
 election.4.t:0 "Election: Fascists in Government?"
 election.4.d:1 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.4.a:0 "Rather them than the communists!"
 election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.5.a:0 "Rather reform than revolution!"
 election.5.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 election.6.t:0 "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 election.6.d:0 "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."

 election.7.t:0 "Fascists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.7.d:1 "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.7.a:0 "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 election.7.b:0 "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 election.8.t:0 "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 election.8.d:0 "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."

 election.11.t:0 "Election: Fascist Majority"
 election.11.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."

 election.11.b:0 "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 election.12.t:0 "Election: Communist Majority"
 election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.12.a:0 "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 election.12.b:0 "We must stop them before they abolish every sign of dissenting thought!"
 election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."

 election.14.t:0 "Election: Wartime Exception"
 election.14.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."
 election.14.a:0 "Elections will be held as usual."
 election.14.b:0 "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 election.15.t:0 "Election: Government Contested"
 election.15.d:0 "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."
 election.15.a:0 "This crisis of trust is highly unfortunate."
 election.15.b:0 "Let the political landscape shift to keep the people united."
 election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 election.17.d:1 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 election.17.a:0 "Splitters!"
 political.1.t:0 "Communism on the Rise"
 political.1.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 political.1.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.1.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a communist coup."

 political.1.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a communist uprising."
 political.2.t:0 "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 political.2.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 political.2.a:0 "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 political.2.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.3.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.3.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 political.4.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 political.5.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 political.5.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 political.5.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 political.6.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.6.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 political.6.b:0 "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 political.7.t:0 "Fascism on the Rise"
 political.7.d:1 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."
 political.7.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 political.7.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a fascist coup."
 political.7.b:0 "The younger generation will take up the torch."
 political.7.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 political.8.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.8.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 political.9.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.9.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 political.10.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.10.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 political.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 political.13.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.13.a:0 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 political.13.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for arranging elections."
 political.13.b:0 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 political.13.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of people voicing support for democracy and forming an opposition."
 political.14.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.14.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 political.14.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.

 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harrassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."

Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."
 stability.22.desc.c:0 "What started as industrial action in a few isolated places has now spread across the entire country, affecting even industries that are only connected to the war effort in tertiary ways. Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind.

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this descision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministeries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

From revolutionaries in the Interior to plotting IJA generals in Nanjing, the Japanese puppet state in China is under siege from all sides.

With the partisans seemingly becoming more bold by the day, and the Reorganized National Army often outgunned by them, at this point expeditions into partisan-plagued Interior China are unthinkable. With many Chinese territories falling under the rule of other Japanese puppets or the Empire itself, the RNGROC is the butt of jokes across all of East Asia.

dmm_easter_egg.1.desc:0 "Yesterday, popular American historical fiction author H.N. Turteltaub released another novel: 'Briefe eines Toten' ('Letters from a Dead Man').\n\nThe book is written as a letter collection from the perspective of a librarian in an alternate 1920's Germany. The protagonist, by sheer coincidence, meets a certain 'Heinrich Luitpold H.', a bespectacled orator of the catholic Bavarian People's Party, in Munich's Hofbräuhaus. In a series of dialogues taking place in the bar, the unnamed librarian convinces 'Mr. H', who complains that the BPP doesn't represent his positions, to try and change his party's policy himself instead of leaving it. A few months hence see 'Mr. H' leading a protest march of the now re-christened 'Greater Germanic People's Party' through Munich, guarded by his personal 'Sicherheitsgruppe' or SG. The letters continue with a faster pace to 1931, when the formerly timid 'Mr. H' (playing on a basis of extreme German Nationalism and Germanic Mysticism) sees electoral success in his bid for the Reich Chancellorship. The epilogue of the novel consists of SG Men storming the librarian's place of work to burn any 'non-Germanic' literature, with the protagonist himself seemingly commiting suicide out of guilt for causing the rise of 'Mr H.' in the first place."

dmm_easter_egg.3.t:0 "Sonnenreich"
dmm_easter_egg.3.desc:0 "German-American author of historical fiction, Thomas Klanzig, published the first work in what literature critics call the 'Sunrise Continuum' today. 'Sonnenreich' opens with a prologue explaining the alternate timeline the novel is set in: Not only does Leon Trotsky take power in the Soviet Union, but Hitler falls victim to a putsch by the charismatic German party official Heinrich Himmler, whose anti-intellectual purges leave Germany severely weakened. After the Fall of France, Himmler invades the Soviet Union in 1941 and is stopped just short of Moscow by fanatic 'Red Brigades' consisting of civilian suicide bombers who throw themselves under German tanks. With the war in the East starting to stalemate in early 1942, Germany cannot muster the necessary forces to invade the United Kingdom, which has become a bridgehead of US troops in Europe. As the Luftwaffe is losing the Battle of Britain, Himmler seeks to rescue his popularity with the people by 'liberating' South Tyrol and invades a fascist Italy that, although begrudgingly, joins the Allies. Trench Warfare-like battles rage throughout Russia and Italy until 1948, when the American Bomber "Memphis Belle" drops a nuclear bomb on Berlin while US and British troops land at Calais. With a decapitated Germany collapsing, American troops raise their flag on the Reich Chancellory in early 1949 and meet Soviet divisions at Warsaw, with Poland being split between the two powers. The War in the Pacific, however has gone in Japan's favor, as the US Navy is completely annihilated by a preemptive Japanese strike. By 1949, Japanese control reaches from Hawaii to Baluchistan, with the cut-off China having surrendered in 1946. With the Soviets in no position to intervene, and Japan carrying out its own nuclear tests in Manchuria, the US agrees to a peace deal that establishes Hawaii as an "International Demilitarised Territory", but leaves Japan in full control of their Southeast Asian and Indian Conquests. The story begins in 1976, in the middle of a Cold War between the United States, the Empire of Japan, and the Soviet Union. It follows the mission of the 'Rainbow Five', a special operations unit made up of members from the US, UK, Italy, West Poland and Germany. They are tasked to find and arrest a spy amongst the US Strategic Command that is planning to sell American ICBM technology to the Japanese. The chase after the spy leads them throughout Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and even China before ending in a climactic three-sided showdown between "Rainbow Five", a Soviet Speznas squad, and Japanese Kempeitai officers in Pusan, Korea. The resulting shootout, in which all three parties kill each other to the last man, has been interpreted as an allegory to Mutually Assured Destruction itself.\n\nWhile some have lauded the work for 'daring to do something differently' and a 'vivid depiction of an alternate world very much unlike our own', others have lambasted Klanzig as crazy for 'believing that such minor figures as Trotsky and mere colonial officers as Himmler could have ever played a role in world politics', deriding 'Sonnenreich' as 'unrealistic'. To no surprise, the book has already been banned in Germany and most of Europe. "

Upon reaching the southern shore of the river, they were, however, met by fanatic resistance by Liu's own 'Patriotic Militias', with the heavy street-to-street fighting reaching a peak during the 'Battle of Guojiashan Road' in which 11 infantry charges by IJA units were successfully resisted.

My plans can be shortly recapitulated by the slogan...'"
rrcdom.2.a:0 "Peace, Rebuilding and Anti-Communism"
rrcdom.2.b:0 "Reform, Recentralization and Rearmament"
rrcdom.3.t:0 "The Assembly is Pleased"
rrcdom.3.d:0 "While the old formula of 'Peace, Rebuilding, Anti-Communism' may be tired, its nostalgic and symbolic value has seemingly pleased the old politicians of the Assembly enough to look at Wang in a positive light."
rrcdom.3.a:0 "A satisfactory performance!"
rrcdom.4.t:0 "A Cliché too far"
rrcdom.4.d:0 "While the old formula of 'Peace, Rebuilding, Anti-Communism' may be tired, Wang calculated on its nostalgic and symbolic value placating the reactionary ranks of the ROC's Assembly. However, the response was quite underwhelming, with open whispers along the lines of 'Again with the tired phrases?'. It seems the Assembly was left thoroughly unimpressed."
rrcdom.4.a:0 "Too Bad."
rrcdom.5.t:0 "Pandemonium on the Floor"
rrcdom.5.d:0 "While Wang had hoped the old parole of 'Peace, Rebuilding, Anti-Communism' would win him favor with the Assembly, this attempt spectacularly backfires, when even the normally staunchly pro-Wang NDPROC back lines started openly criticizing him for offering 'only words, no solutions'. Soon, Wang was being insulted from all directions, but mostly from the Liuist PNR-YP bloc."
rrcdom.5.a:0 "Why are you booing me? I'm right!"
rrcdom.6.t:0 "The Assembly Cheers"
rrcdom.6.d:0 "With Wang promising to finally take a course of Recentralizion and Rearmament, he seems to have won the heart of the Assembly, with even Liu Zhongjing shortly applauding before lightly scolding Wang for his centralization plans."
rrcdom.6.a:0 "A great start!"
rrcdom.7.t:0 "The Assembly is Pleased"
rrcdom.7.d:0 "Wang's assessment of China's problems and his strategies for problem solution were quite well received by the Assembly, with most politicians present, even some of the PNR-YP, applauding at the end of the speech. The large exception to this was, obviously, Liu Zhongjing, who sat silently, staring at Wang all throughout the speech."
rrcdom.7.a:0 "He will never be pleased by anyone's speeches but his own"
rrcdom.8.t:0 "The Critique of the United Front"
rrcdom.8.d:0 "The moment Wang had finished his speech, Liu sprang into action, starting what some have described as 'a round of harsh questioning' and 'nothing short of a full cross-examination'. By the end of it, Liu had bored several rhetorical holes into Wang's argumentation and proceeded to call for a public referendum to determine the presidency."
rrcdom.8.a:0 "The pipedreamer, that will never happen."

rrcdom.9.t:0 "The Assembly in Disorder!"
rrcdom.9.d:0 "With Youth Party politicians interrupting Wang Jiebing's address, pandemonium has broken out on the Assembly Floor, with PNR-YP and NDPROC members shouting at each other and some even throwing pens or folders. The whole situation finally starts to calm down when Jiebing loudly calls for order..."
rrcdom.9.a:0 "...and order is restored!"
rrcdom.9.b:0 "...but Liu begins a shouting match with him!"

rrcdom.10.t:0 "Liuist Rally in Nanjing"
rrcdom.10.d:0 "With his popularity as high as ever among the common people, Liu Zhongjing has arrived to speak to a large crowd near the Mount Zhongshan Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Gardens. Obviously choosing the place for its connection to the Republic's father, Liu is prepared to deliver a great speech on the topic of the 'Institutional Weakness of Republican Authority'. There have already been reports of counter-protesters assembling in the direction of Houzaimen District, and National and Kempeitai police units standing by, cautiously watching the situation unfold. Now it all depends on what happens next..."
rrcdom.10.a:0 "Liu is allowed to hold his speech"
rrcdom.10.b:0 "The police violently break up the crowds"

rrcdom.11.t:0 "The Ministries declare for Wang"
rrcdom.11.d:0 "The Ministers of the RNGROC have always been creatures of its president, so it comes with no surprise that they have announced their support of his son, Wang Jiebing, today."
rrcdom.11.a:0 "Unsurprising"

rrcdom.12.t:0 "The RNA brass makes its allegiance known"
rrcdom.12.d:0 "The Reorganized National Army of the Republic of China is the official Army of our Republic, but it is mostly a paper tiger due to numerous disarmament agreements with Japan going back all the way to the late 40s. Nevertheless, the RNA has an important role as a guarantor of internal security and as a propaganda instrument. The power struggle between Liu and Wang evidently split even the High Command, as only today, after some lengthy deliberation, the Army Brass has unanimously come forward to announce their support for..."
rrcdom.12.a:0 "Wang"
rrcdom.12.b:0 "Liu"

rrcdom.14.t:0 "A Knife to the Throat"
rrcdom.14.d:0 "With the government falling apart in the power struggle resulting from Wang Wenying's death, multiple local garrisons across southern China have been reportedly overwhelmed by mobs of locals supposedly led by a 'National Salvation Council', with partisans in the Huangshan, Ganzhou and Eastern Jiangxi areas joining the uprising soon after. With the majority of the RNA, left leaderless in the wake of governmental collapse, either standing down or outright proclaiming allegiance to these revolutionaries, the situation across China has deteriorated to the point where it could no longer be ignored by the Japanese. The general of the IJA's Nanjing Garrison, Kōichi Isobe, has allied with several other IJA generals commanding the occupation forces in interior China, and has called for all Japanese units to vacate the Interior and deploy in coastal northern China. Abandoning Nanjing as a position 'not defensible enough', Kōichi, his garrison, and the majority of the city's Kempeitai units have withdrawn beyond the Great Yangtze. Although the Interior has collapsed into anarchy, Kōichi has stated this course of action to be 'the only way to save Japanese interests and accomplishments in Shina'.\nIt seems the Great Rivers of China will soon be red with blood once more."
rrcdom.14.a:0 "We shall give the Japanese another Ten Years War of Resistance!

rrcdom.15.t:0 "The Garrison Steps In"
rrcdom.15.d:0 "With the government apparently 'abandoning their commitment to Greater East Asia and Japan during the last few weeks', the IJA Garrison has moved to occupy the Assembly of the RNGROC as well as the Ministries of the Interior and Security. With Liu and Wang apparently 'disappearing' during this action, General Kōichi Isobe has assumed 'temporary control' over the RNGROC's government."
rrcdom.15.a:0 "This does not bode well..."

rrcdom.16.t:0 "The Inauguration of Wang Jiebing"
rrcdom.16.d:0 "Today, Wang Jiebing has been officially inaugurated as the President of the ROC. Calling for 'reconciliation, reform and recentralization' in his address, Wang has, on the contrary, already started cracking down on the PNR-YP front. China has survived these initial trubles, but at what cost?"
rrcdom.16.a:0 "But what happens to a collapse deferred?"

rrcdom.17.t:0 "The Arrest of Mr. Liu"
rrcdom.17.d:0 "This morning, at 5:30 AM, Kempeitai and National Police units raided the Headquarters of the PNR-YP Party Alliance on Xiaojingwei Street, hoping to capture the upper echelons of the party. The officers reportedly caught Mr. Liu packing his suitcase in a great hurry, and subsequently arrested him."
rrcdom.17.a:0 "Well Done!"

rrcdom.18.t:0 "The Snake Escapes"
rrcdom.18.d:0 "This morning, at 8:30 AM, Kempeitai and National Police units raided the Headquarters of the PNR-YP Party Alliance on Xiaojingwei Street, hoping to capture the upper echelons of the party. Although many lower-ranking functionaries were arrested, subsequent interrogations revealed that Mr. Liu, together with several of his closest associates, left the house by car at approximately 6:00 AM that morning. Police have lost their trace east of Hefei, and there is little hope to catch him now."
rrcdom.18.a:0 "Damn It!"

rrcdom.19.t:0 "Great Leader Liu Seizes Power"
rrcdom.19.d:0 "Today, our Great Leader Liu Zhongjing was officially inaugurated as President of the Republic of China. Promising 'autonomy and development', Liu was greeted by cheering crowds outside of his house every time he stepped outside. The only ones silent were the outspoken supporters of Mr. Wang, who, despite Liu's calls for 'reconciliation and civility', often found themselves hunted by furious mobs. Liu has already promised 'extensive reform', and many in the NDPROC fear that this will mean purging them..."

rrcdom.20.d:0 "At 9:00 AM this morning, the limousine carrying Wang Jiebing passed a grassy knoll to the north of Guangzhou Road on the way to a private meeting with Great Leader Liu. Suddenly, two shots were fired, with one bullet entering Wang's back, penetrating his neck and damaging a spinal vertebra. The second bullet hit Mr. Wang's head directly afterwards, and although he was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, he died at 2:34 PM today. A film of the entire event was reportedly seized by local police units."

There, under the leadership of Ma Jiyuan, they coalesced into something akin to a warlord state of pre-War China, proclaiming themselves the only legitimate Interim Government of the Republic of China, more commonly referred to as the 'Qinghai-Haixi Army'. Ever since, they have recruited from the local population and republican loyalists from across China with the goal of 'national liberation and restoration of proper moral governance'. What exactly that would entail is vague, though it would most certainly see the army brass 'guiding' the state."

Hitler led Germany into Victory, Speer into prosperity, and Heydrich into madness and instability. And may a new Fuehrer and the reformed Reichstag lead us into victory and prosperity once more. However Germany's once iron grip on Europe and Africa is slipping under Reichsmarschall Schneiderhan's provisional government, who's been ruling for over a decade. The Reichstags vote must be fast or else we may lose everything our grandfathers fought so hard for. As the world marches ever faster towards a most certain war, in the absence of MAD, we need a leader, and badly so."
